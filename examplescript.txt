When a movie is as successful
as the 1996 hit Independence Day

you can practically guarantee a sequel.

But they usually land
a little faster than this.

The original movie answered the question
"is there anybody out there"

with a pretty emphatic "yes"

and back then became the second
highest grossing movie of all time.

In Indepedence Day Resurgence, 
cast favourites Jeff Goldblum,

Judd Hirsh and Bill Pullman are back
 - but so are the aliens.

But that's not the only Hemsworth
Goldblum will be sharing the screen with

he's set to shoot the next Thor movie
with Chris Hemsworth here

in Australia from next month.

Meantime Liam, Jeff and writer/director

Roland Emmerich will visit our shores
to promote Resurgence next week.

The movie opens on 23rd June.
