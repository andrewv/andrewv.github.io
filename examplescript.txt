When a movie is as successful as the 1996 hit Independence Day, you can practically guarantee a sequel.
But they usually land a little faster than this.

The original movie answered the question "is there anybody out there" with a pretty emphatic "yes" - and back then became the second highest grossing movie of all time.

In Indepedence Day Resurgence, cast favourites Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsh and Bill Pullman are back - but so are the aliens.

But that's not the only Hemsworth Goldblum will be sharing the screen with - he's set to shoot the next Thor movie with Chris Hemsworth here in Australia from next month.
Meantime Liam, Jeff and writer/director Roland Emmerich will visit our shores to promote Resurgence next week.

The movie opens on 23rd June.
